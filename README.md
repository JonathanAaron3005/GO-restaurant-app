# GO-restaurant-app
This project is a simple restaurant app made in Go through HTTP. This is my first project using Go to create a REST API. In this project, I use PostgreSQL as the database.
This project is part of a certified course that I took at [kelas.work](https://kelas.work/site), namely "Basic Go-Lang for Back End Developers".

### Technologies Used
* Language: Go
* Database: PostgreSQL
